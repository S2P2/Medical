> [Guideline for Perinatal Care](https://www.acog.org/clinical-information/physician-faqs/-/media/3a22e153b67446a6b31fb051e469187c.ashx) Chapter 6

## Prenatal Care Visits

1st : typically 1st-trimester  
Frequency: individualized

- Uncomplicated
  - GA 0-28 : 4 wk
  - GA 28-36 : 2 wk
  - GA 36+ : 1 wk

### First Visit

#### Information that should be discussed

- Scope of care provided
- Lab - indications
- Expected course of pregnancy
- Signs/symptoms and how to report
- Anticipated schedule of visits
- Labor and delivery coverage
- Cost
- Risk counseling - substance use
- Psychosocial topics - pregnancy, postpartum
- Review of family Hx, genetic testing options

#### Past pregnancies

- Prior preterm delivery
  - SPB, PPROM -> 2nd-trimester: Progesterone IM
- Previous preeclampsia
  - High risk -> ASA 81 mg/day
- Prior gestation diabetes
  - early screening for glucose intolerance
- Prior midtrimester loss, cervical insufficiency
  > Indications for Cervical Cerclage in Women with Singleton Pregnancies
  >
  > - History
  >   - Hx of 2nd-trimester pregnancy loss
  >     - Painless cervical dilation
  >     - No labor
  >     - No placental abruption
  >   - Prior cerclage due to painless cervical dilation
  > - PE
  >   - Painless cervical dilation in 2nd-trimester
  > - U/S Finding with Hx of Prior Preterm Birth
  >   - Current singleton pregnancy
  >   - Prior SPB at GA < 34 wk
  >   - Cervical length < 25 mm at GA < 24 wk

## Routine Antepartum Care

### Determining Gestational Age (GA)

- U/S in 1st-trimester (up to 13+6 wk) -> most accurate
- if assisted reproductive tech used -> use age of embryo for EDD
- LMP + first accurate U/S -> EDD

*without* U/S before GA 22 0/7 wk -> suboptimally dated

- Timing of delivery based on best clinical estimate of GA
- No role for elective delivery
- Amniocentesis for fetal lung maturity is not recommended as a routine component of decision making when considering the delivery
- Consider F/U U/S 3-4 wks after initial U/S to support GA
- Consider antepartum fetal surveillance at GA 39 wk (prevent late delivery)

#### Guidelines for Redating Based on U/S

GA by LMP (wk) | \|U/S - LMP\| if true ->  U/S
---------|---------
 0 - 8 6/7 | >5d
 9 0/7 - 13 6/7 | >7d
 14 0/7 - 15 6/7 | >7d
 16 0/7 - 21 6/7 | >10d
 22 0/7 - 27 6/7 | >14d
 28 0/7 + | >21d

 0 - 13 6/7 wk -> CRL  
 14 0/7+ wk-> BPD, HC, AC, FL

### Fetal Ultrasound Imaging

if no other specific indications, optimal time for single U/S -> GA 18-22 wk

[Obstetric Ultrasound](OBGYN\obstetric-ultrasound.md) for details

### Routine Lab Test

- Blood type
- D (Rh) type
- Antibody screen
- CBC
- VDRL/RPR
- Urine screening +- Urine culture
- HBsAg
- HIV counseling/testing
- Chalmydia
- Gonorrhea (when indicated)
- Mantoux tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay (when indicated)

### Antepartum Immunizations
