# Early Pregnancy Loss

## Background

### Definition

* a nonviable, **intrauterine** pregnancy **GA < 13** wk with (1)
  * an **empty** gestational sac
  * a gestational sac containing an embryo or fetus **without fetal heart activity**
In the 1st trimester, these terms are used interchangeably
  * miscarriage
  * spontaneous abortion
  * early pregnancy loss

### Incidence

* **10%** of **all** pregnancies (/clinically recognized/)
* **80%** of pregnancy loss in **1st trimester**

### Etiology and Risk Factors

* **50%** due to fetal **chromosomal abnormalities**
* Risk factors
  * AMA (advanced maternal age)
    * 20-30 yr => 9-17%
    * 35+ => 20%
    * 40+ => 40%
    * 45+ => 80%
  * prior early pregnancy loss

## Clinical Considerations and Recommendations

### Diagnosis

* History
  * Symptom - normal, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy
    * vaginal bleeding
    * uterine cramping
* Physical examination
* U/S
  * CRL ≥ 7mm, no heartbeat (CRL=Crown-rump length)
  * MSD ≥ 25mm, no embryo (MSD=Mean sac diameter)
  * gestational sac w/o yolk sac, f/u ≥2wk no embryo w/ heartbeat
  * gestational sac _w/ yolk sac_, f/u ≥11day no embryo w/ heartbeat
  * f/u U/S 7-10d if
    * CRL < 7mm, no heartbeat
    * MSD 16-24 mm, no embryo
    * no embryo for ≥6wk after LMP
    * empty amnion
    * yolk sac >7mm
    * MSD - CRL < 5mm
    * gestational sac w/o yolk sac, f/u 7-13d no embryo w/ heartbeat
    * gestational sac _w/ yolk sac_, f/u 7-10d no embryo w/ heartbeat
* serum β-hCG - ↑suggests Ectopic Pregnancy

### Management

no evidence of different long-term outcomes

* Expectant Management
  * only 1st trimester
  * up to 8wk
  * success rate 80%
  * may experience moderate-heavy bleeding and cramping
  * educational material for patient - when and who to call for excessive bleeding
  * pain medications
  * counsel อาจต้องผ่า ถ้าไม่หมด
  * commonly used criterion for complete expulsion
    * no gestational sac
    * endometrial thickness < 30mm
  * if cannot f/u U/S
    * UPT
    * serial quantitative serum β-hCG
* Medical Management
  * **w/o**
    * infection
    * hemorrhage
    * severe anemia
    * bleeding disorders
  * compared with expectant management
    * ↓ time to expulsion
    * ↑ rate of complete expulsion w/o surgery
  * Protocol
    * Misoprostol 800 mcg vaginally, repeat dose if no response to 1st dose, 3hr - 7d
    * Mifepristone 200 mg orally 24 hr before misoprostol ถ้ามี
    * pain medications
    * Rh(D) neg and unsensitized
      * Rh(D)-immune globulin within 72hr after 1st misoprostol
    * f/u 7-14d U/S check complete expulsion
      * if no U/S, serial serum β-hCG
    * if medical fails, expectant mx with ob-gyn, or suction curettage
